## Description

**NeXeonSystems-Website-Monitor** is a real-time website monitoring system designed to keep track of the health and status of websites and services.

- **Mobile-responsive UI** for accessibility across all devices
- **Socket.IO** integration for live updates without page refreshes
- **Monitoring of multiple websites** with a scalable, easy-to-use interface
- **Uses Chart.js** to make the users see if the site is down or up.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeXeonSystems/NeXeonSystems-Website-Monitor.git
cd NeXeonSystems-Website-Monitor
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Add Sites to Monitor

The monitored sites are configured in the `config.json` file. 

1. Open `config.json` in your project folder.
2. It will look like this by default:

```json
{
  "Sites": [
    { "name": "", "domain": "", "port":  }
  ]
}
```

3. Add your own websites by filling in the `"name"`, `"domain"`, and `"port"` fields.

For example:

```json
{
  "Sites": [
    { "name": "Example", "domain": "example.com", "port": 80 },
    { "name": "Example2", "domain": "example2.com", "port": 8080 }
  ]
}
```

Once you've added your websites, the system will monitor them and display their status on the front-end.

### Running the Application

Start the application with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the server, and you can access the monitoring dashboard in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

The status page will show:

- **Green** (up) if the website is online and accessible.
- **Red** (down) if the website is offline or unreachable.

## Example Output

Once everything is set up and the sites are running, your site monitor page will look like this:

- Green circle for sites that are **up**.
- Red circle for sites that are **down**.
- Chart will show green if the site is **up**.
- Chart will show red if the site is **down**.
